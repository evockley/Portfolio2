        <h2>Bio</h2>
        <p>Coming to design, I bring a lifetime of essential human-centered skills to my UX practice. As a musican, I
            crafted performances to evoke emotional responses in my audience. In my fashion career, I’ve served people
            from all walks of life and found success in getting to the heart of their problems, nurturing relationships
            and creating smooth end-to-end user experiences. As a custom clothing specialist, I have vast experience
            delivering products people want.</p>

        <p>I have studied Product Design and earned certificates from General Assembly and The George Washington
            University. Previously, I earned a Master of Music degree from Carnegie Mellon University. Colleagues past
            and present have described me as a methodical, adaptable, naturally curious people person.</p>

        <h2>Skills</h2>

            <div>
                <h3>User Interviews</h3>
                <p>All those years in sales have paid off. I’m highly skilled at idenifying what I don’t know and
                    working out a way to figure it out, including crafting interview plans and rolling with the punches
                    to identify user needs.
                </p>

                <h3>Rapid Wireframes</h3>
                <p>I’m a believer of the pencils before pixels mantra. I sketch ideas so I can test them early with
                    paper prototypes. Sketches often fail, but I learn from failures to move forward more effectively.
                </p>

                <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
                <p>With my background, competitive analysis comes naturally. Musicians listen to musicians for
                    inspiration and education. In fashion, we evaluate competitors to identify areas of differentiation.
                    I apply these perspectives to my design practice.
